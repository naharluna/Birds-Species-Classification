## 📁 Project Structure

- `capstone-birds-species-classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code, visualizations, and step-by-step model development.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to build an image classification model that can identify and classify bird species from images using a CNN-based architecture. This work demonstrates the application of deep learning in solving real-world biodiversity and conservation-related challenges.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset contains images of different bird species, preprocessed and augmented to ensure balanced and robust training.
- Common preprocessing steps included resizing, normalization, and augmentation, such as flipping, zooming, and rotation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed using the Keras Sequential API.
- Key layers include:
  - Multiple `Conv2D` layers
  - `MaxPooling2D`
  - `Dropout` for regularization
  - `Flatten` and `Dense` layers
- `Softmax` activation used in the final layer for multi-class classification.
